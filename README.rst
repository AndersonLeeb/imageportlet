Features

* Inline image upload from a local computer into the portlet

* Image can act as a banner link or simply server decorative purposes

* Plain text slots for heading, footer, over-the-image text (button) and ``<img>`` alt text

Benefits
----------

The benefit over static text portlet + TinyMCE uploaded images is that
the image blob exist within the portlet. The management interface is simpler
and you do not separate image bank. The management is much streamlined for non-power users.
